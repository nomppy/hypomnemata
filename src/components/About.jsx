      <h2>What is a hypomnēmata?</h2>

      <p>
        The <em>hypomnēmata</em> (ὑπομνήματα) were personal notebooks kept
        in the ancient Greek and Roman world — not diaries or journals, but
        something closer to a commonplace book. A place to gather fragments:
        quotes encountered in reading, thoughts overheard in conversation,
        principles worth returning to, reflections born from experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Stoic philosophers practiced this most deliberately. Marcus
        Aurelius's <em>Meditations</em> began as hypomnēmata — private
        notes never meant for publication, written to remind himself how
        to live. Seneca urged his friend Lucilius to collect and revisit
        such passages daily. Epictetus's students recorded his teachings
        in the same spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Michel Foucault, writing about these notebooks in "Self Writing,"
        described them as tools for <em>self-formation</em>. The practice
        isn't about hoarding knowledge. It's about gathering what Foucault
        called "the already-said" — then letting those fragments work on
        you through rereading and meditation, shaping how you think, how
        you respond, who you become.
      </p>

      <p>
        The method is simple: collect what strikes you. Return to it later.
        Let time change what you see in it.
